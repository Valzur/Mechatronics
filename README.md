# Line follower simulation

This was supposed to be my mechatronics project simulation of a line follower robot that shoots a basket ball into a basket, 
But it turned into a detailed simulation of how the arduino modules, as well as how the electrical components' signals would behave.
The actual line following algorithm was not implemented.


## Installation
The project was intended to work inside the unity environment, made with Unity 20120.3.17f1, and thus there are no release binaries provided.
